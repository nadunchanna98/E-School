PROBLEM STATEMENT ( 2 main reasons )

1) Because of Covid and Political instability in the country the school education 
ceased for almost one year. That period online teaching methods which were 
used during the pandemic times (Such as zoom) for the school children were 
failed to be effective learning method for the majority of the students due to 
many reasons.

2) Apart from that a student from a rural area would rarely get an opportunity 
to learn from a well experienced teacher in a well reputed school, in our 
education system.




SOLUTION

I am introducing a simple web application which allows teachers 
and students to easily handle. 

• Teachers can upload their recorded class videos and notes timely. Also, student details 
and their marks also can be handled in an easy way. 
• Students will be able to access the study materials (Videos, PDF) at any time at any 
device as per his/her convenience. Students can submit the completed assignments.
• In case if some students couldn’t attend on time they can download and refer the 
uploaded study material.
• There are only main key features in this system with user friendly interface. Then 
Teachers and students can access easily.
• Admin Allow access to update insert and delete the teachers details and subject details.
